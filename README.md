# Calanus
Albout-Boyer et al. 2016 Calanus GAMM

To do
 + Start by focusing on stage 5 Calanus finmarchicus (Cfin_CV in the data spreadsheet)
 + Seasonal time series, ideally back to 1950
 + First stab: 
   1) build model using Caroline's data, but just SST and bathymetry, 
   2) use bathymetry and seasurface temperature (ERSST goes back to 1950) to project model
